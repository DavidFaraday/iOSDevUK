How to train your developers to use this new tech stack? and many other questions like thisâ€¦  \nI would love to tell you how we manage to introduce SwiftUI as part of our development process and we made this process as seamless as possible for our team of developers.",

A command line tool that is written entirely in Swift and uses modern concurrency to interact with the CI provider's API and collect data.\n2. A CI workflow that runs every night and collects the data for a given day using the command line tool we've created.\n3. A serverless function (I'll show two options where this can be deployed) using Swift and modern concurrency to process the data and persist it. This serverless function will also trigger an alarm and send a message on Slack if any of the builds exceed a threshold duration.\n4. A website that acts as a dashboard to display all the data collected. Again, this will be built exclusively with Swift - We won't write any HTML files directly.\nThe aim of the talk is to give you an insight at why Swift is a great option for writing complex developer tooling which go way beyond scripts and command line tools.",

I will fill it with (attempts of) jokes and high energy to try and turn an intensive topic into a fun one!!\nDescription: \nI always loved creating apps and making things, and I still do. But as I worked on optimising my code and learning modern development techniques, I was always curious about what happens when you press that Build button in Xcode. What's going on behind the curtain? How does that turn your code into an app. I was fascinated by this, however, I never satisfied this curiosity until I jumped in the deep end, and started working as a mobile infrastructure engineer at Spotify.\nIn this talk I want to demystify the build process, explain build systems, and share my knowledge to help people form a solid foundation to build their infrastructure knowledge on.",
